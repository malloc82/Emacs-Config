Proggy Clean Slashed Zero Bold Punctuation is identical to the well-liked Proggy Clean but has a slashed zero instead of a dot.

In addition, this font contains some bold punctuation characters and delimiters. The bold characters make things like variable scope (braces/brackets/parentheses are bold) and function arguments (commas etc are bold) more apparent to the eye.

Use at point size 9 (bitmap font)
