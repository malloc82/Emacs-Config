Real programmers use Proggy Tiny. Proggy Tiny Slashed Zero is identical to Proggy Tiny but has a slashed zero instead of a dot.

Proggy Tiny is well-proportioned and is the smallest programming font I could come up with while maintaining distinctive characters and good readability. I use this quite often where I want a high information density.

Use at point size 9 (bitmap font)
