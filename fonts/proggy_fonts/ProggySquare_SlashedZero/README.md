Proggy Square Slashed Zero is identical to Proggy Square but has a slashed zero instead of a dot.

Proggy Square has a slightly tighter line spacing than Proggy Clean, but is still extremely easy to read.

Only the bitmap ANSI version has all the extended characters. The ttf and pcf files are missing some of the extended characters.

Use at point size 9 (bitmap font)
