Proggy Square has a slightly tighter line spacing than Proggy Clean, but is still extremely easy to read.

Use at point size 9 (bitmap font), 12 (truetype), or 16 (mac truetype)

The bitmap .fon version of this font includes 2 font files. One is the ANSI extended version, and the other is OEM extended. The latter is a console font and can be selected in console applications on Windows machines. Further, only the bitmap ANSI version has all the extended characters. The ttf and pcf files are missing some of the extended characters.
