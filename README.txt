Installation:

    1. Save the emacs.el as ~/.emacs
    2. Save the emacs.d diretory as ~/.emacs.d

Note:
    - You might want to change the LaTeX setting a bit. The one I'm using is customized 
      for tetex on OS X 10.5
    - For python files, you must have Pymacs install, or you can also comment out the 
      pymacs section in my-python.el
    - You are welcome to give any suggestion you may have.
