*** Error message in Emacs CVS:
    - Warning: `save-excursion' defeated by `set-buffer'
*** Possible solutions:
    - [[http://old.nabble.com/%60save-excursion'-defeated-by-%60set-buffer'-td26840925.html][Solution 1]]:
      save-excursion only saves point in the current buffer, so 
      (save-excursion (set-buffer foo) (goto-char (point-min))) 
      will move point in foo and the point-saving done by save-excursion is 
      useless.  So either you want to use 
      (save-current-buffer (set-buffer foo) (goto-char (point-min))) 
      aka 
      (with-current-buffer foo (goto-char (point-min))) 
      if moving point in foo is what you wanted, or 
      (with-current-buffer foo (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)))) 
      if you didn't want to move point in foo.
